3. keep track of non-travellable features for visual aid (in Campus)
6. figure out how to make the graph gradually, fully connected
    - this is the min-connection problem
    - run connected components - O(m + n)
    - connect the closest components - O(n^2)
    - connect them using "bushwacking" or something
    - always connect smallest distance between them, but also connect anything under a certain distance threshold
    - say, 20 ft (and only on different components)
4. draw different paths different colors (walkways, bikeways, etc.)
5. Recover "directions" using state path transitions
    - when we were riding bike / driving car
    - when we parked bike / car
    - use these to paint the path
